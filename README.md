# Ecommerce API using MVC Architecture with MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js

Welcome to the Ecommerce API project! This project aims to build a scalable and feature-rich API for an ecommerce platform using the MVC architecture, MongoDB for data storage, Express.js for handling HTTP requests, and Node.js as the runtime environment.

## Features

- **MVC Architecture**: Organized codebase with clear separation of concerns for models, views, and controllers.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Utilizes MongoDB, a NoSQL database, for flexible and scalable data storage.
- **Express.js Framework**: Implements routing, middleware, and other features using Express.js, a minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implements secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive data and actions.
- **CRUD Operations**: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing ecommerce data.
- **Scalability**: Built with scalability in mind to handle a large number of concurrent users and transactions.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Ecommerce API project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-api.git`
2. **Install Dependencies**: `npm install`
3. **Set Up MongoDB**: Install MongoDB locally or configure connection to a MongoDB instance.
4. **Start the Server**: `npm start`
5. **Explore the API**: Access the API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl.

## Project Structure

- `/models`: Contains MongoDB models for defining data schemas and interactions.
- `/views`: Not applicable for an API project, but included for completeness in the MVC architecture.
- `/controllers`: Implements business logic and handles requests/responses.
- `/routes`: Defines API endpoints and routes.
- `/middlewares`: Contains custom middleware functions for request processing.
- `server.js`: Entry point of the application.
